# Project Assignment 4: More Code, a Notebook, and a README.md

Last week you started coding the data loading, processing and analysis functionality as well as a command-line interface for your project in plain .py files. Finish this programming work before you proceed to the next project steps described in this assignment.


1. Develop a **computational narrative** for your project and implement it in a Jupyter notebook. Make to meet the following requirements:
        
        a. The computational narra6ve is presented in one Jupyter Notebook.
    
        b. Longer pieces of code, especially when not directly meaningful for the narrative (for example details of the data pre-processing when loading the data from the CSV files), are stored in separate .py modules and imported to the notebook.
    
        c. The notebook has different sec6ons, including introductory text with a description of the data set, data loading, the different analyses with explanations, a summary/conclusion, and possible references.


    Feel free to be creative and add additional features. For example, integrate additional datasets in the analysis, have a look into geovisualiza6on or make analyses interactive. Of course, you can easily challenge yourself more in this project by trying more sophisticated analyses. The Python ecosystem is full of interesting data science libraries, browse the web for inspiration.


2. Add a **README.md** file to your project and start to fill it with content. It does not have to be complete at this stage, but should contain a project overview, a usage guide and contact information. (We will get back to the full list of key components of README files in the next weeks and add more content.)
