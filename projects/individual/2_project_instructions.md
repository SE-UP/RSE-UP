# Project Assignment 2: Setting Up the Repository on Git.UP

This week’s project assignment focuses on seLng up the project repository on Git.UP, so that you are ready to manage all your project code and data on the platform. The following takes you through the steps you should perform this week:

1. First challenge: Give your project a name that you can use for your local working
directory, your Git.UP repository etc. Be aware that changing such a name later is
possible, but not exactly easy, so try to find something sensible.


2. Using that name, create a blank project repository on Git.UP. Set the “Visibility Level” to
“private”, and do not let Git.UP initialize the repository with a README. **TODO** Invite Akshay
Devkate (GitLab username devkate) as a member with role “Reporter”, so that he can
see your project, give feedback, and eventually access the project for grading.


3. On your computer, create a (local) project directory (it is recommended to use the same name as on Git.UP). To begin with, add the following content:
- A .gitignore file that contains __pycache__
- A data/ directory where you put your chosen dataset in .csv format.
- A docs/ directory where you add a simple text file description.txt where you add the description of your dataset and research questions that you wrote for last week’s worksheet.


We will add several further files and directories as we proceed with the project, but this is sufficient for the moment.


4. Make your local project directory a Git repository (git init), then connect it to your remote project repository on Git.UP (git remote add origin). Add, commit and push your project files to the staging area, local repository and remote repository, respectively.


5. Done for this week! Next week we will start coding and adding further relevant files to the project.
