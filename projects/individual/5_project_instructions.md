# Project Assignment 5: Add License and Citation Informatoon

Now that you have already made considerable progress with your project, perhaps even finished most of the implementation, it is Eme to think a bit more about how to share it with
the scientific community. At the moment your project repository on Git.UP is probably only visible to yourself, the tutors and selected other individuals, but we will continue to work on it assuming that it might become public at some point.

    1. Think about the **license** that you want to give your project. Consider the aspects discussed in the lecture, and/or consult choosealicense.com to find the license that you would like to use. Make a copy of the license text, fill in the relevant project information, and add it to your project as a separate license file. Then mention it in your project’s README, providing a link to the license file.

    2. Add (basic) **citation information** in the form of a .cff file to your project. You can use the cffinit tool (hLps://citation-file-format.github.io/cff-initializer-javascript/#/) to create it. Like with the license information, mention the availability of citation information it in your README, providing a link to the .cff file.

Optonally, analyze your project for compliance with the “Five Recommendations for FAIR software” and other best practices using the “howfairis” tool (hLps://pypi.org/project/howfairis/). Is the assessment helpful? What would you need to do to increase your score? (You don’t have to do it.)
