# Project Assignment 3: Requirements, Architecture, Design and Implementation

The Instructions below contain a set of assignments to work out the requirements and architecture of your group project, if applicable also the object-oriented design, and to start with the implementation (programming).

## Requirements and Architecture

This assignment will guide you through a very simple and pragmatic requirements elicitation and analysis process for narrow-scope research soFware projects (cf. DLR Application Class 1).

1. In your project repository, create a `docs/` folder and add a file `requirements.md`.
2. Add a section there for functional requirements and collect the relevant user stories for your project there. Make sure to follow the structure of the user story template sentence “As a [user role], I want \[action/features] so that \[benefit/reason].”
3. Prioritize the user the stories with the MoSCoW method.
4. Add a section for non-functional requirements and describe any additional considerations that cannot be captured by user stories. Use natural language, but try to be very concise.
5. For both functional and non-functional requirements, feel free to use other kinds of requirements documentation (like use cases, UML diagrams, mockups, prototypes) if you feel a need for expressing additional information.

Based on the requirements, discuss a suitable architecture for your project. Document the decision in a file `architecture.md` that you also put in the `docs/` folder.

## OO Design

Discuss if you follow a procedural or object-oriented programming approach in your project (or a mixture of both). If OOP, identify the classes that you need to implement. Document them (with names, atiributes and methods) and their relationships in a UML class diagram. Add that to the `docs/` folder of your project, too.

## Implementation

When requirements, architecture and design are (relatively) stable and documented, you can start with the actual implementation (coding). For that, proceed as follows:

1. From the list of (prioritized) user stories, select the next ones to work on.
2. Break the selected user stories down into smaller, manageable implementation tasks.
3. Create issues for the identified tasks in the issue tracker of your project, and assign them to one team member.
4. Finish the implementation tasks and integrate the new code in the project. Remember to use a branch-and-merge workflow when working on issues.
5. Resolve issue.
6. Consider re-prioritizing user stories.
7. Repeat from 1. until all (selected) stories are implemented (or project ended).

Keep in mind that requirements can change during the project, for example because new ideas come in or because you have overlooked something in the initial requirements elicitation phase. Be prepared to revise the requirements documentation, architecture and implementation tasks accordingly.
