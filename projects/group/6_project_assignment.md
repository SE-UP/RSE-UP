# Project Assignment 6: Finish and Submit the Project 

This assignment contains a set instructions on how to finalize the second course project (Group Project).

## Finish and Submit Project

Revisit **TODO** group assignments 1-5 to check that you have completed every instructions. 
This includes:

- Your project resides in a GitLab repository, where all team members work on it. **TODO** Akshay is added as a reporter, so that he can access all project content.
- Project requirements and architecture are documented in respective Markdown files.
- If applicable, your custom objects are documented.
- Issues are used to break down user stories into smaller tasks, and guide the implementation of the project.
- The project makes used of (automated) testing, error handling and possibly logging.
- Where appropriate, the program is made configurable.
- The project is set up as a Python package, including extended documentation.


Naturally, we expect you to also follow the good prac0ces you already learned in the first project, including:
- Standard project structure (directories for code, data, results, documentation; a README, project meta-information like license, citation, documentation, etc.)
- Sensible modularization of project code
- Clean and readable code

You might also want to check the grading rubric (available on Moodle) before wrapping up. Finally, create a release as submission:
1. On Git.UP, go to your project page.
2. In the left sidebar, select “Deployments > Releases” and select “New release”.
3. On the page that opens, enter “v1.0” as tag name and “submission” as release title. The other fields can be left as they are.
4. Click “Create release” at the bocom of the page. 
5. Done. **TODO** (Akshay is reporter on your project and can see and access this release, so there is no need to submit your project anywhere else.)


##  Answer the Project Questionnaire

Please answer the short project questionnaire on Moodle **TODO** (https://moodle2.uni-potsdam.de/mod/feedback/view.php?id=1975415). It contains ques0ons about your project, but also about the development process and your experiences. 
We will use the answers for getting an overview about the projects and obtained results, for reflecting on the second project, and also for revising the project assignments in a next edition of the course.
