## Chapter Working in Teams

### Exercise 1

-   Our license is at <https://github.com/merely-useful/py-rse/blob/book/LICENSE.md>.

-   Our contribution guidelines are at <https://github.com/merely-useful/py-rse/blob/book/CONTRIBUTING.md>.

### Exercise 2

The `CONDUCT.md` file should have contents that mimic those given in Section \@ref(teams-coc).

### Exercise 3

The newly created `LICENSE.md` should look something like the example
MIT License shown in Section \@ref(teams-license-software).

### Exercise 4

The text in the `README.md` might look something like:

```text

file for guidelines on how to contribute.
Please note that this project is released with a
[Contributor Code of Conduct](CONDUCT.md).
By contributing to this project,
you agree to abide by its terms.
```

Your `CONTRIBUTING.md` file might look something like the following:

```text
# Contributing

Thank you for your interest
in contributing to the Zipf's Law package!

If you are new to the package and/or
collaborative code development on GitHub,
feel free to discuss any suggested changes via issue or email.
We can then walk you through the pull request process if need be.
As the project grows,
we intend to develop more detailed guidelines for submitting
bug reports and feature requests.

We also have a code of conduct
(see [`CONDUCT.md`](CONDUCT.md)).
Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.
```

### Exercise 5

Be sure to tag the new issue as a feature request to help \gref{triage}{triage}.

### Exercise 6

We often delete the `duplicate` label:
when we mark an issue that way,
we (almost) always add a comment saying which issue it's a duplicate *of*,
in which case it's just as sensible to label the issue `wontfix`.

### Exercise 7 

Some solutions could be:

- Give the team member their own office space so they don't distract others.
- Buy noise-cancelling headphones for the employees that find it distracting.
- Re-arrange the work spaces so that there is a "quiet office" and a regular
office space and have the team member with the attention disorder work
in the regular office.

### Exercise 8

Possible solutions:

- Change the rule so that anyone who contributes to the project, in any way,
gets included as a co-author.
- Update the rule to include a contributor list on all projects with descriptions
of duties, roles, and tasks the contributor provided for the project.

### Exercise 9 

We obviously can't say which description fits you best, but:

-   Use \gref{three sticky notes}{three_stickies}
    and \gref{interruption bingo}{interruption_bingo}
    to stop *Anna* from cutting people off.

-   Tell *Bao* that the devil doesn't need more advocates,
    and that he's only allowed one "but what about" at a time.

-   *Hediyeh*'s lack of self-confidence will take a long time to remedy.
    Keeping a list of the times she's been right
    and reminding her of them frequently is a start,
    but the real fix is to create and maintain a supportive environment.

-   Unmasking *Kenny*'s hitchhiking will feel like nit-picking,
    but so does the accounting required to pin down other forms of fraud.
    The most important thing is to have the discussion in the open
    so that everyone realizes he's taking credit for everyone else's work
    as well as theirs.

-   *Melissa* needs a running partner---someone to work beside her
    so that she starts when she should and doesn't get distracted.
    If that doesn't work,
    the project may need to assign everything mission-critical to someone else
    (which will probably lead to her leaving).

-   *Petra* can be managed with a one-for-one rule:
    each time she builds or fixes something that someone else needs,
    she can then work on something she thinks is cool.
    However,
    she's only allowed to add whatever it is to the project
    if someone else will publicly commit to maintaining it.

-   Get *Frank* and *Raj* off your project as quickly as you can.
