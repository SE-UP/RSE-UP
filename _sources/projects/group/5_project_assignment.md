# Project Assignment 5: Program Configuration, Packaging and Documentation

## Configuration

In the lecture we discussed four layers of possible program configuration (overlay configuration, where each level overrides the one above):

1. A system-wide configuration file for general settings.
2. A user-specific configuration file for personal preferences.
3. A job-specific file with settings for a particular run.
4. Command-line options to change things that commonly change.


Discuss in your team which level and kind of configuration would be useful for your project, and implement configuration mechanisms accordingly. 
Follow the approaches discussed in the lecture, and consult Chapter on [Configuring Programs](https://software-engineering-group-up.github.io/RSE-UP/chapters/configuration.html) of our reference textbook for further details and background information.


## Packaging and Documentation

You will only need to create an actual package for the project submission deadline, but it is advisable to set up the packaging infrastructure and configuration already now. Follow the steps discussed in the lecture to set up your project for creating a Python package, test package installation with a virtual environment, and set up the Sphinx framework for automated generation of function-level documentation. Extend and revise the README file and Docstrings as you go. Consult the Chapter on [Creating Packages with Python](https://software-engineering-group-up.github.io/RSE-UP/chapters/python_packaging.html) and [Documetation](https://software-engineering-group-up.github.io/RSE-UP/chapters/writing_documentation.html) of our reference textbook for further details and background informa7on
