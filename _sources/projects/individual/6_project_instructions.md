# Project Assignment 6: 

Below are the instructions on how to finalize the first, individual course project.


## Assignment 1: Finish and Submit Project

Revisit the instructions 1-5 to check that you have completed the project assignments. Your
project structure should now look something like:

```
project1/
├── .gitignore
├── CITATION.cff
├── LICENSE.txt
├── README.md
├── bin
│ └── ...
├── data
│ └── ...
├── results
│ └── ...
└── ...
```

Note that it is also fine to use `/src` instead of `/bin` for the directory containing the code files. While differentiated naming matters for compiled languages like C and Java, for Python the difference is not really noticeable, so both are accepted. 
Go again through all project files, check for correctness and style, and adjust where needed. You might also want to check the grading rubric **TODO** (available on Moodle) before wrapping up.

**Finally, create a release as submission:**

1. On Git.UP, go to your project page.

2. In the left sidebar, select “Deployments > Releases” and select “New release”.

3. On the page that opens, enter “v1.0” as tag name and “submission” as release title. The other fields can be left as they are.

4. Click “Create release” at the bottom of the page.

5. Done. **TODO** (Akshay is reporter on your project and can see and access this release, so there is
no need to submit your project anywhere else.


## Assignment 2: Answer Project Questionnaire

Please answer the short project questionnaire on Moodle **TODO** (htps://moodle2.uni-
potsdam.de/mod/feedback/view.php?id=1953462). 
It contains questions about your project, but also about the development process and your experiences. We will use the answers for presenting an overview of the projects in one of the next lectures, for motivating the second
project, and also for revising the project assignments in a next edition of the course.
