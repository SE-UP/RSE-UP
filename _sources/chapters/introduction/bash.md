Computers do four basic things: store data, run programs,
talk with each other, and interact with people.
They do the interacting in many different ways, of which **graphical user interfaces** (GUIs) are the most widely used.
The computer displays icons to show our files and programs,
and we tell it to copy or run those by clicking with a mouse.
GUIs are easy to learn but hard to automate,
and don't create a record of what we did.

In contrast, when we use a **command-line interface** (CLI) we communicate with the computer by typing commands,and the computer responds by displaying text.
CLIs existed long before GUIs; they have survived because they are efficient,
easy to automate, and automatically record what we have done.
