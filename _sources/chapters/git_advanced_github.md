# Forking on Github 

Since some of the readers are not University of Potsdam members, and thereby have no UoP Gitlab account we have included the original Github instructions used in the book by Irving et all.

## Using Other People's Work - GITHUB version

So far we have used Git to manage individual work,
but it really comes into its own when we are working with other people.
We can do this in two ways:

1.  Everyone has read and write access to a single shared repository.

2.  Everyone can read from the project's main repository,
    but only a few people can commit changes to it.
    The project's other contributors **fork** the main repository
    to create one that they own,
    do their work in that,
    and then submit their changes to the main repository.

The first approach works well for teams of up to half a dozen people
who are all comfortable using Git, but if the project is larger,
or if contributors are worried that they might make a mess in the `master` branch, the second approach is safer.

Git itself doesn't have any notion of a "main repository",
but \gref{forges}{forge} like Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket or selfhosted solutions like Gitea all encourage people to use Git in ways that effectively create one.
Suppose, for example, that Sami wants to contribute to the Zipf's Law code that
Amira is hosting on GitHub at `https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf`.
Sami can go to that URL and click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner
([Figure: fork button](git-advanced-fork-button)).
GitHub immediately creates a copy of Amira's repository within Sami's account on GitHub's own servers.

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/github_fork_button.png
:name: git-advanced-fork-button

Git Fork button
```

When the command completes, the setup on GitHub now looks like [Figure: after fork](git-advanced-after-fork).Nothing has happened yet on Sami's own machine:
the new repository exists only on GitHub.
When Sami explores its history, they see that it contains all of the changes Amira made.

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/after-fork.png
:name: git-advanced-after-fork

Git: After Fork
```

A copy of a repository is called a **clone** In order to start working on the project, Sami needs a clone of *their* repository (not Amira's) on their own computer. We will modify Sami's prompt to include their desktop user ID (`sami`
 and working directory (initially `~`) to make it easier to follow what's happening:


```bash
sami:~ $ git clone https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git
```

```text
Cloning into 'zipf'...

remote: Counting objects: 100% (64/64), done.

Receiving objects: 100% (64/64), 2.20 MiB | 2.66 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (20/20), done.
```

This command creates a new directory with the same name as the project,
i.e., `zipf`. When Sami goes into this directory and runs `ls` and `git log`,
they see that all of the project's files and history are there:

```bash
sami:~ $ cd zipf
sami:~/zipf $ ls
```

```text
README.md       bin             data             results
```

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git log --oneline -n 4
```

```text

        Merging README additions
45a576b Added contributor list
a0b88e5 Added repository overview
232b564 Initial commit of README file
```

Sami also sees that Git has automatically created a **remote** for their repository that points back at their repository on GitHub:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git remote -v
```

```text
origin  https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (push)
```

Sami can pull changes from their fork and push work back there, but needs to do one more thing before getting the changes from Amira's repository:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git remote add upstream
              https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git
sami:~/zipf $ git remote -v
```

```text
origin      https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (fetch)
origin      https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (push)
```

Sami has called their new remote `upstream` because it points at the repository
from which theirs is derived. They could use any name, but `upstream` is a nearly universal convention. 

With this remote in place, Sami is finally set up. Suppose, for example,
that Amira has modified the project's `README.md` file to add Sami as a contributor. (Again, we show Amira's user ID and working directory in her prompt to make it clear who's doing what):

```text
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text
files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
- Sami Virtanen
```

Amira commits her changes and pushes them to *her* repository on GitHub:

```bash
amira:~/zipf $ git commit -a -m "Adding Sami as a contributor"
```

```text

   55c63d0..35fca86  master -> master
```

\newpage

Amira's changes are now on her desktop and in her GitHub repository
but not in either of Sami's repositories (local or remote).
Since Sami has created a remote that points at Amira's GitHub repository,
though, they can easily pull those changes to their desktop:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git pull upstream master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]      master     -> upstream/master
Updating 55c63d0..35fca86
Fast-forward
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Pulling from a repository owned by someone else is no different than pulling from a repository we own. In either case, Git merges the changes and asks us to resolve any conflicts that arise. 
The only significant difference is that, as with `git push` and `git pull`,
we have to specify both a remote and a branch:
in this case, `upstream` and `master`.

## Pull Requests

Sami can now get Amira's work, but how can Amira get Sami's?
She could create a remote that pointed at Sami's repository on GitHub
and periodically pull in Sami's changes, but that would lead to chaos, since we could never be sure that everyone's work was in any one place at the same time.
Instead,
almost everyone uses **pull requests**. They aren't part of Git itself,
but are supported by all major online **forges**.

A pull request is essentially a note saying, "Someone would like to merge branch A of repository B into branch X of repository Y."
The pull request does not contain the changes, but instead points at two particular branches. That way, the difference displayed is always up to date
if either branch changes.

But a pull request can store more than just the source and destination branches:
it can also store comments people have made about the proposed merge.
Users can comment on the pull request as a whole, or on particular lines,
and mark comments as out of date if the author of the pull request updates the code that the comment is attached to. Complex changes can go through several rounds of review and revision before being merged,
which makes pull requests the review system we all wish journals actually had.

To see this in action, suppose Sami wants to add their email address to `README.md`. They create a new branch and switch to it:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git checkout -b adding-email
```

```text
Switched to a new branch 'adding-email'
```

then make a change and commit it:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git commit -a -m "Adding my email address"
```

```text
[adding-email 3e73dc0] Adding my email address
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git diff HEAD~1
```

```

Sami's changes are only in their local repository. They cannot create a pull request until those changes are on GitHub, so they push their new branch to their repository on GitHub:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git push origin adding-email
```

```text

 * [new branch]      adding-email -> adding-email
```

When Sami goes to their GitHub repository in the browser, GitHub notices that they have just pushed a new branch and asks them if they want to create a pull request ([Figure: after push](git-advanced-after-sami-pushes)).

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/after-sami-pushes.png
:name: git-advanced-after-sami-pushes

Git after Push
```

When Sami clicks on the button, GitHub displays a page showing the default source and destination of the pull request and a pair of editable boxes for the pull request's title and a longer comment ([Figure: pull request start](git-advanced-pull-request-start)).

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/open-pull-request.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-start
Start a pull request
```

If they scroll down, Sami can see a summary of the changes that will be in the pull request ([Figure: pull request summary](git-advanced-pull-request-summary)).

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/open-pull-request-detail.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-summary
Git pull request summary
```

The top (title) box is autofilled with the previous commit message,
so Sami adds an extended explanation to provide additional context
before clicking on "Create Pull Request"
([Figure: fill in pull request](git-advanced-pull-request-fill-in)).
When they do, GitHub displays a page showing the new pull request,
which has a unique serial number ([Figure :New pull request](git-advanced-pull-request-new)).
Note that this pull request is displayed in Amira's repository rather than Sami's, since it is Amira's repository that will be affected if the pull request is merged.

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/fill-in-pull-request.png

Git Fill in pull request
```

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/new-pull-request.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-new
Git new pull request
```

Amira's repository now shows a new pull request
([Figure: view Pull requests](git-advanced-pull-request-viewing)).
Clicking on the "Pull requests" tab brings up a list of PRs
([Figure: list pull requests](git-advanced-pull-request-list))
and clicking on the pull request link itself displays its details
([Figure: pull request details](git-advanced-pull-request-details)).
Sami and Amira can both see and interact with these pages,
though only Amira has permission to merge.

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/viewing-new-pull-request.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-viewing
View pull request

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-list.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-list

```

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-details.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-details

Git pull request details
```

Since there are no conflicts,GitHub will let Amira merge the PR immediately using the "Merge pull request" button. She could also discard or reject it without merging using the "Close pull request" button. Instead,
she clicks on the "Files changed" tab to see what Sami has changed
([Figure: Pull request - request changes](git-advanced-pull-request-changes)).

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-changes.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-changes
Pull request changes
```

If she moves her mouse over particular lines, a white-on-blue cross appears near the numbers to indicate that she can add comments
([Figure: Pull request - comment marker](git-advanced-pull-request-comment-marker)).
She clicks on the marker beside her own name and writes a comment:
She only wants to make one comment rather than write a lengthier multi-comment review, so she chooses "Add single comment" ([Figure: Pull request - write a comment](git-advanced-pull-request-write-comment)).
GitHub redisplays the page with her remarks inserted ([Figure: Pull Request with comment](git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-comment)).


```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-comment-marker.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-comment-marker

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-writing-comment.png

```

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-with-comment.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-comment
Pull request with comment
```

While Amira is working, GitHub has been emailing notifications to both Sami and Amira. When Sami clicks on the link in their email notification, it takes them to the PR and shows Amira's comment. Sami changes `README.md`, commits, and pushes, but does *not* create a new pull request or do anything to the existing one.
As explained above, a PR is a note asking that two branches be merged,
so if either end of the merge changes, the PR updates automatically.

Sure enough, when Amira looks at the PR again a few moments later she sees Sami's changes ([Figure: Pull Request with fix](git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-fix)).
Satisfied, she goes back to the "Conversation" tab and clicks on "Merge".
The icon at the top of the PR's page changes text and color to show that the merge was successful
([Figure: - Pull Request - succesfull merge](git-advanced-pull-request-successful-merge)).

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-with-fix.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-fix
Pull request with fix
```

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-successful-merge.png
:name: git-advanced-pull-request-successful-merge
PR successful merge
```

To get those changes from GitHub to her desktop repository,
Amira uses `git pull`:

```bash
amira:~/zipf $ git pull origin master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 35fca86..a04e3b9
Fast-forward
 README.md | 4 ++--
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

To get the change they just made from their `adding-email` branch into their `master` branch, Sami could use `git merge` on the command line. It's a little clearer, though, if they also use `git pull` from their `upstream` repository (i.e., Amira's repository) so that they're sure to get any other changes that Amira may have merged:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git checkout master
```

```text
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
```

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git pull upstream master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 35fca86..a04e3b9
Fast-forward
 README.md | 4 ++--
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

Finally, Sami can push their changes back to the `master` branch
in their own remote repository:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git push origin master
```

```text
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git
   35fca86..a04e3b9  master -> master
```

All four repositories are now synchronized.

## Handling Conflicts in Pull Requests

Finally, suppose that Amira and Sami have decided to collaborate more extensively on this project. 
Amira has added Sami as a collaborator to the GitHub repository.
Now Sami can make contributions directly to the repository,
rather than via a pull request from a forked repository.

Sami makes a change to `README.md` in the `master` branch on GitHub.
Meanwhile, Amira is making a conflicting change to the same file in a different branch. When Amira creates her pull request, GitHub will detect the conflict and report that the PR cannot be merged automatically ([Figure: - Pull Request Conflict](git-advanced-pr-conflict)).

```{figure} ../figures/git-advanced/pr-conflict.png
:name: git-advanced-pr-conflict
Pull request conflict
```

Amira can solve this problem with the tools she already has.
If she has made her changes in a branch called `editing-readme`, the steps are:

1.  Pull Sami's changes from the `master` branch of the GitHub repository
    into the `master` branch of her desktop repository.

2.  Merge *from* the `master` branch of her desktop repository
    *to* the `editing-readme` branch in the same repository.

3.  Push her updated `editing-readme` branch to her repository on GitHub.
    The pull request from there back to the `master` branch of the main repository
    will update automatically.

GitHub and other forges do allow people to merge conflicts through their browser-based interfaces, but doing it on our desktop means we can use our favorite editor to resolve the conflict.
It also means that if the change affects the project's code,
we can run everything to make sure it still works.

But what if Sami or someone else merges another change while Amira is resolving this one, so that by the time she pushes to her repository there is another, different, conflict? In theory this cycle could go on forever;
in practice, it reveals a communication problem that Amira (or someone) needs to address. If two or more people are constantly making incompatible changes to the same files, they should discuss who's supposed to be doing what,
or rearrange the project's contents so that they aren't stepping on each other's toes.
