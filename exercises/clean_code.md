# Exercises - Clean Code

In this Repo we have included a [folder](https://gitup.uni-potsdam.de/seg/rse_course/rse_course_materials/zipf) called `zipf`. Your task is to *clean* the code we have supplied. 
You need to rewrite some function and check for mistakes using pycodestyle. 

you can install pycodestyle on mac and linux using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install pycodestyle
```
And you run it by: 

```bash
pycodestyle PYTHON-FILE.py
```
or if you want to check all .py in a directory you can also use:
```bash
pycodestyle *.py
```
