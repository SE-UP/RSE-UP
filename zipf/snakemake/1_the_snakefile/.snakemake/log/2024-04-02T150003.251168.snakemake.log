MissingOutputException in rule count_words_moby_dick in file /home/nibe/PROJECTS/RSE-UP/zipf/snakemake/1_the_snakefile/snakefile, line 17:
Job 2  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
../../results/moby_dick.dat
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
