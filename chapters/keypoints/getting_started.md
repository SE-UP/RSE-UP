- Make tidiness a habit, rather than cleaning up your project files later.
- Include a few standard files in all your projects, such as README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CONDUCT and CITATION.
- Put runnable code in a `bin/` directory.
- Put raw/original data in a `data/` directory and never modify it.
- Put results in a `results/` directory. This includes cleaned-up data and figures (i.e., everything created using what's in `bin` and `data`).
- Put documentation and manuscripts in a `docs/` directory.
- Refer to The Carpentries [software installation guide](https://carpentries.org/) if you're having trouble, or send us an email.
