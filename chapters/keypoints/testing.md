-   Test software to convince people (including yourself) that software is correct enough
    and to make tolerances on "enough" explicit.
-   Add **assertions** to code so that it checks itself as it runs.
-   Write **unit tests** to check individual pieces of code.
-   Write **integration tests** to check that those pieces work together correctly.
-   Write **regression tests** to check if things that used to work no longer do.
-   A **test framework** finds and runs tests written in a prescribed fashion and reports their results.
-   Test **coverage** is the fraction of lines of code that are executed by a set of tests.
-   **Continuous integration** re-builds and/or re-tests software every time something changes.
