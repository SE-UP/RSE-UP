-   Use a **branch-per-feature** workflow to develop new features while leaving the master branch in working order.
-   `git branch` creates a new branch. 
-   `git checkout` switches between branches.
-   `git merge` **merges** changes from another branch into the current branch.
-   **Conflicts** occur when files or parts of files are changed in different ways on different branches.
-   Version control systems do not allow people to overwrite changes silently;
    instead, they highlight conflicts that need to be resolved.
-   **Forking** a repository makes a copy of it on a server.
-   **Cloning** a repository with `git clone` creates a local copy of a remote repository.
-   Create a remote called `upstream` to point to the repository a fork was derived from.
-   Create **pull requests** to submit changes from your fork to the upstream repository.
