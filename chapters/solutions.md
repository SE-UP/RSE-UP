# Solutions 

The exercises included in this book represent a wide variety of problems, from multiple choice questions to larger coding tasks.

It's relatively straightforward to indicate a correct answer for the former, though there may be unanticipated cases in which the specific software version

you're using leads to alternative answers being preferable.
It's even more difficult to identify the "right" answer for the latter,
since there are often many ways to accomplish the same task with code.

Here we present possible solutions that the authors generally agree represent "good" code, but we encourage you to explore additional approaches.

Commits noted in a solution reference **TODO** Amira's `zipf` repository on GitHub, which allow you to see the specific lines of a file modified to arrive at the answer.
