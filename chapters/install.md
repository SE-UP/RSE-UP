# Installing the Software

In order to conduct our analysis, we need to install the following software:

1. A **Shell** ( Bash, ZSH, Fish,...)
2. **Git** version control
3. A text editor
4. [Python 3](https://www.python.org) or using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com)( see below)
5. [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

*Note* While Anaconda seems easy to install, depending on the use case it might be more efficient and simpler to use Python [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) to install some necessary packages. 

Comprehensive software installation instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems
(with video tutorials) are maintained by [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/)
as part of their workshop website template at:

<https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup>

We can follow those instructions to install the Bash shell, Git, a text editor and Anaconda.
We recommend Anaconda as the method for installing Python,
as it includes Conda as well as many of the packages we'll use in this book.

You can check if Make is already on your computer by typing `make -v` into the Bash shell.
If it is not, you can install it as follows:

- *Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)*: Install it from the Bash shell using `sudo apt-get install make`.
- *Mac*: Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (via the App Store).
- *Windows*: Follow the [installation instructions]( https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/install_ds_stack_windows/#make) maintained by the
  Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

### Tools 

To finish your work, you need some environment to code in. Thus, you need some means to edit text. 
You could install VS Code, Jetbrains Pycharm (free EDU version), or Neovim, Helix, Emacs, there are no requirements, but having an install of VS Code might make it easier, since VS code can run Jupyter notebooks without you having to install the whole Anaconda ecosystem and messing arround with and starting jupyter notebook servers. Instead of running the Notebooks in your Browser, you can use VScode including all python linting etc..


## Notes on using Anaconda
While it is not necessary,  you may use the Anaconda platform, for that go to [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system. For more information on working with anaconda click [here](https://se-up.github.io/RSE-UP/chapters/anaconda.html).
