# Research Software Engineering - University of Potsdam

This repository contains material for a semester-long course on computing skills for researchers at the Univeristy of Potsdam. The course uses the material provided in the Merely-useful book (<https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/>) as a base and makes some changes to the structure and adds additional topics.
