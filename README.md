# Research Software Engineering - University of Potsdam



This repository contains material for a semester-long course on computing skills for researchers at the Univeristy of Potsdam. The course uses the material provided in the [Merely-useful book](https://third-bit.com/py-rse/) as a foundation and makes some changes to the structure and adds additional topics.

**PLEASE NOTE** currently still a WIP! 

[ ] CICD SECTION -> problems with RUNNER on University Instance
